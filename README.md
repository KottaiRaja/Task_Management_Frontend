# Task Master - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the TaskMaster application, a modern, responsive web-based task management application developed with React and Tailwind CSS.

[See Live Demo](https://task-management-frontend-pied-nu.vercel.app/)

## ‚ú® About The Project

This frontend application provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for managing tasks. The frontend application interacts with a distinct backend API to fulfill the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality; and delivers the user experience as a single-page application (SPA).

### Main Features:

*   **Responsive:** Beautifully crafted, mobile-first design that works on all devices; desktop, tablet, mobile.
*   **Interactive Data Table:** 
    *   **Client-Side Sorting:** Sort data by clicking on table headers, like `Task` and `Due Date`.
    *   **Client-Side Filtering:** Filter the task list using dropdowns on `Status` and `Priority` headers.
*   **Search Field:** Search for tasks in real-time, simply by typing into the search bar.
*   **Global State:** Global state is provided and managed by React's Context API and the `useReducer` hook for efficient, predictable state management.
*   **Modern Boilerplate:** Built with Vite, a new build tool that helps speed-up development.
*   **Component-based Design:** The application follows a component-and-page based approach to enable reuse, maintenance, and logical organization.
